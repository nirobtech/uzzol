## 🧠 Why This Project?

> After a long journey of survival, I decided to automate everything — my work, my income, my learning, and my life.  
> — **Uzzol / Nirobtech**

This project came from the idea of rebuilding after total failure. Using only:

- ✅ A mobile with Termux
- ✅ A basic Ubuntu laptop
- ✅ 2GB shared hosting
- ✅ Public APIs + GitHub
- ✅ Free & Open Source tools

I am building a system that will:

- Automate posting, marketing, earning
- Run on mobile without rooting
- Help me earn, learn, grow every day
